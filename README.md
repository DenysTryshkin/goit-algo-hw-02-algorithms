## 📌 Tasks

### ✅ Task 1 — Service Request Processing System

Develop a program that simulates the operation of a service center:

* automatically generates new requests;
* adds them to a queue;
* processes requests sequentially by removing them from the queue.

**Requirements:**

* the `Queue` class from the `queue` module is used;
* the program logic follows the provided pseudocode;
* handling of the situation when the queue is empty is implemented.

### ✅ Task 2 — Palindrome Checker

Implement a function that determines whether a given string is a palindrome:

* all characters are added to a double-ended queue;
* characters are compared from both ends of the queue;
* the program is case-insensitive and ignores spaces;
* works correctly for strings with both even and odd numbers of characters.
